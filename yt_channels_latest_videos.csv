Today Sony unveiled the $699 PS5 Pro but does this most expensive PlayStation ever actually make sense? I dive deep into Sony's surprising announcement of the PS5 Pro, breaking down its impressive specs and eye-opening $699 price tag. From its beefed-up GPU to enhanced ray tracing capabilities, I explore whether this powerhouse console is worth the steep upgrade. Plus, I speculate on how games like GTA 6 might leverage this new hardware and what it means for the future of console gaming.

Apple's latest event was bittersweet. Sure we got some pretty big upgrades for the iPhone 16, but is the Pro REALLY worth the extra cash? And where are the Air Pods Pro 3, or the Apple Watch Ultra 3?

It can be hard to decide how much to spend on a computer or gaming setup, so today we try out computers at four VERY different price points to see what the experience is like, and maybe help you decide how much you'd want to spend. $50?... $500? $5,000? $50,000?

I decided to put Amazon's new AI assistant Rufus to the test by having it pick out some cool tech gadgets for me. What started as a skeptical experiment quickly turned into a surprisingly fun unboxing adventure, with everything from a miniature go-kart to a powerful digital microscope. While not every item was a winner, Rufus managed to find some genuinely impressive and entertaining tech that I probably wouldn't have discovered on my own.

After the leak in Linus' home rack watercooling setup, most of the hardware fortunately survived, except for the ~$5000 UPS battery backup unit that powers most of his hardware! Fortunately, we found a shipping damaged unit on ebay that can be frankensteined together to hopefully have one functioning UPS. Do not try this at home.

I took the plunge and bought the REDMAGIC 9S Pro to see if gaming phones are still worth it in 2024. Despite some impressive specs and benchmarks, I discovered some major drawbacks that make me question the whole concept of gaming phones. This is why I think you're better off with a regular flagship or dedicated handheld for gaming.

The ASUS ROG Matrix Platinum is hands down the BEST 4090 you can buy. Except for the fact that it costs $3200. Considering that Nvidia's card is supposed to retail for literally half that, I bet that a watercooling noob could PAY themselves to learn. Buy all pump, radiators and waterblocks from companies like Corsair, Bykski, EK Waterblock, and Optimus cooling and STILL have money to spare.

Testing for ROG Matrix was performed with the CPU cooled by an Arctic Liquid Freezer III 360

In this deep dive, I explore the rollercoaster history of Sony's most ambitious console ever - the PlayStation 3. From its rocky $600 launch to becoming a surprising success, the PS3's journey is filled with fascinating twists, groundbreaking tech, and high-stakes drama. I break down how Sony's massive gamble nearly backfired, the console's evolution over time, and its lasting impact on the gaming industry.

After putting in all the work to link all my family's gaming systems into one mega loop that is cooled by my pool, suddenly there was a leak. Water spilled all over my Ryzen Gaming systems, my NAS servers and my UPSs. I reached out to EK Waterblock for help, but the source of the issue is still a mystery. Am I screwed?

I put four popular back-to-school laptop deals to the test to see which retailer between Best Buy, Amazon, Target and Walmart offers the best value. Through comparisons of performance, practicality, and price, I uncovered some surprising results about these so-called ""deals"". In the end, an unexpected winner emerged as the clear best choice for students on a budget.

Did you know you can buy gamer gear at the local Home Depot? Although Team Green and Team Red might be referring to Ryobi and Milwaukee within the walls of the depot, they DO carry all the accessories from RGB keyboards to desks to webcams. The quality, however, will leave you needing to make another trip back just to patch the holes in these shoddily made products. More like Home Depoo, amirite.

In this video, I take a journey back to the Xbox 360 era as we approach the final days of its digital store. I explore some of the best deals and hidden gems still available, while also testing how well the system holds up in 2024. Along the way, I uncover some surprising insights about backwards compatibility and the importance of preserving these classic games.

AMD, Intel, Nvidia, Apple and pretty much everyone else think you are an IDIOT. They think they can just mislead consumers by tweaking their naming schemes for their hardware (Remember the RTX 4080 12GB?) and making them more confusing. How bad has it become? We're gonna tell you.

Nintendo makes GREAT games, and bad decisions. With one of the most aggressive stances on piracy and homebrew, we‚Äôve seen them come after gamers time and time again. It‚Äôs time to equip you with the tools to fight back with these console mods that will free you from their archaic limitations, and allow you to unlock the true potential of the machines you paid good money for. HDMI upgrades, Type C power, Migswitch, JAILBREAKING - and MORE!

While most of these updates and features for iPad OS 18, iOS 18, and MacOS Sequoia aren't exactly new, it was pretty cool seeing them at Apple's 2024 WWDC event. Is their version of AI or ""Apple Intelligence"" going to be the first one the average person uses on a daily basis? DoesT9 on iPhone matter to anyone but Linus? Will Tim Cook FINALLY find a way to sell more Vision Pros?

Have you ever thought ""Laptops sure are great, but I wish they had 3 monitors, desktop components, and weighed 20 times as much""? Good news! With the MaCase B43 chassis your PC can go from a portable, reasonably powered slate that lives in your backpack to a monstrously huge Frankenstein machine capable of running several instances of Crysis. This thing games so hard you'll totally forget about the disc you slipped in your back while trying to get it up onto the table.

üìù TV Technology Acronym Breakdown
Most brands stick by the rule of calling the TV technology what it is in the name. LED, QLED, OLED, Mini-LED, QD-OLED, etc. But every so often you‚Äôll see a name that sounds fancy but is nothing more than a marketing name for a specific TV technology. Here are some of the most notable ones.

‚Ä¢ QLED
Hisense: ULED
Amazon: Omni QLED

‚Ä¢ Mini-LED
Samsung Neo QLED (A Mini-LED TV with a quantum dot layer over it)
LG QNED (LG‚Äôs Mini-LED technology with quantum dot)
TCL OZ Zero (TCL Mini-LED technology with quantum dot layer)

‚Ä¢ OLED
Companies will differentiate between OLED, W-OLED, and QD-OLED.
OLED in 2024 will have a 3-diode array. Sets older than 2020 may have difficulty with brightness in ultra-bright rooms
W-OLED has a 4-diode array, with one of them being a dedicated white light diode. Produced brighter overall OLED picture
QD-OLED is an OLED panel with quantum dot technology over it, producing a brighter color image and more color-accurate image.

Is it still safe to buy an iPhone 15 Pro in 2024 with the iPhone 16 Pro on the horizon? Let's talk about it!
